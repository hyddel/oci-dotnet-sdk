    /// of measuring usage and billing, access (through the use of IAM Service policies), and isolation (separating the
    /// resources for one project or business unit from another). A common approach is to create a compartment for each
    /// major part of your organization. For more information, see
    /// [Overview of IAM](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com//Content/Identity/getstarted/identity-domains.htm) and also
    /// [Setting Up Your Tenancy](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/GSG/Concepts/settinguptenancy.htm).
    /// <br/>
    /// To place a resource in a compartment, simply specify the compartment ID in the \"Create\" request object when
    /// initially creating the resource. For example, to launch an instance into a particular compartment, specify
    /// that compartment's OCID in the `LaunchInstance` request. You can't move an existing resource from one
    /// compartment to another.

    /// To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized,
